## RxDB

This application relies heavily on [rxdb](https://rxdb.info) for an offline database with push/pull replication.

    This application is currently using RxDB v12.
    The documentation is for v13 and so there may be some differences

    Documentation for RxDB v12.7.16 can be found at:
    https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/tree/fc96cc8c5b46339d345a861b33274aaa98fda54e

### Schema
